## Overview
This is the configuration for my GitOps homelab Kubernetes cluster. This cluster runs home software services for my residence. It is quite complex and there are a lot of interdependencies but the declarative nature of GitOps allows me to manage this mesh of code. The software services fall into a few primary categories:
* Home Automation ([Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/), [Node-Red](https://github.com/node-red/node-red), [EMQX](https://github.com/emqx/emqx), [ZWave JS UI](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-ui), [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/))
* Home Metering and Monitoring (Weather Station, Power Monitoring, Sensors)
* Home Security ([Frigate](https://frigate.video/), [Double Take](https://github.com/jakowenko/double-take))
* IOT Devices ([WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/), [Ratgdo](https://github.com/PaulWieland/ratgdo))

 ## Notes
 To get metrics-server to work with kubeadm, you need to do the following if it isn't setup with the clusterconfig provided to kubeadm
 https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-certs/#kubelet-serving-certs
 * Need to pull the kubeadm configuration into this repository

[Limits and Requests Philosophy](https://rwlove.github.io/home-ops/limits.html)

 [@whazor](https://github.com/whazor) created [this website](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) as a creative way to search Helm Releases across GitHub. You may use it as a means to get ideas on how to configure an applications' Helm values.
