## Overview
This is the configuration for my GitOps homelab Kubernetes cluster. This cluster runs home software services for my residence. It is quite complex and there are a lot of interdependencies but the declarative nature of GitOps allows me to manage this mesh of code. The software services fall into a few primary categories:
* Home Automation ([Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/), [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/))
* Media Management ([Kodi](https://kodi.tv/))
* Home Metering and Monitoring (Weather Station, Power Monitoring, Sensors)
* Home Security ([Frigate](https://frigate.video/), [Double Take](https://github.com/jakowenko/double-take), [Konnected](https://konnected.io/))

## Github Webhook
`kubectl -n flux-system get receivers.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io` generates token URL to be put into
github.com -> Settings -> Webhooks -> Payload URL

* Content Type: application/json
* Secret: <token from kubectl -n flux-system describe secrets github-webhook-token>
* SSL: Enable SSL verification
* Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?: Just the push event.
* Active: <checked>
 
 ## Notes
 To get metrics-server to work with kubeadm, you need to do the following if it isn't setup with the clusterconfig provided to kubeadm
 https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-certs/#kubelet-serving-certs
 * Need to pull the kubeadm configuration into this repository
 
 ### Resources: Limits and Requests Philosophy
 In short, do set CPU requests, but don't set CPU limits and set the Memory limit to be the same as the Memory requests.
